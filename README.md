Overview
This Django API provides endpoints for managing data entries, which are accessed and manipulated by a React frontend. The API supports basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and is hosted on PythonAnywhere.

API Endpoints
Below are the primary endpoints provided by the API:

GET /api/items/: Retrieve a list of items.
POST /api/items/: Create a new item.
GET /api/items/<id>/: Retrieve a specific item by ID.
PUT /api/items/<id>/: Update a specific item by ID.
DELETE /api/items/<id>/: Delete a specific item by ID.
Note: Replace items with the actual name of your resource.
